Tspf is a library for parsing the TSPLIB file format, a text-based file format often used in the research field of travelling salesman problem (TSP), vehicle routing problem and other related problems. Some well-known TSP solvers (e.g. [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/index.html) or [LKH](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/)) work mainly with this file format as inputs.

The parser is implemented based on the [documentation](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) from the Department of Discrete and Combinatorial Optimization at Ruprecht-Karls-UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg.

The library can fully parse all problem datasets hosted on TSPLIB's [website](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/):
- [X] TSP - symmetric travelling salesman problem  
- [X] HCP - Hamiltonian cycle problem  
- [X] ATSP - asymmetric travelling salesman problem  
- [X] SOP - sequential ordering problem  
- [X] CVRP - capacitated vehicle routing problem  
- [X] Tour - a collection of tours 

Moreover, it also provides common metric functions to calculate edge weights (or cost/distance) between nodes in public interface. Among them are:
- [X] 2D- and 3D-Euclidean distance
- [X] 2D- and 3D-Manhattan distance
- [X] Geographical distance

This is a sister project from [cykl-rs](https://github.com/1crcbl/cykl-rs), a heuristic solver for TSP, which is still under-development.

## Usage
To parse an input string, we use the function ```parse_str``` from the struct ```TspBuilder```:
```rust
use tspf;

match TspBuilder::parse_str("some input string") {
    Ok(tsp) => {
        // tsp is an instance of struct Tsp.
        // From tsp, one can access all data.
    }
    Err(e) => eprint!("{:?}", e),
}
```

On the other hand, the function ```parse_path``` handles the parsing from files:
```rust
use std::path::Path;
use tspf;

let path = ;
match TspBuilder::parse_path(Path::new("path/to/some_file.tsp")) {
    Ok(tsp) => {
        // tsp is an instance of struct Tsp.
        // From tsp, one can access all data.
    }
    Err(e) => eprint!("{:?}", e),
}
``` 

**NOTES**:
- The files ```si175.tsp```, ```si535.tsp```, ```si1032.tsp``` from the TSP dataset require a small change: the type entry in the second line ```TYPE: TSP (M.~Hofmeister)``` is wrong according to the format definition. Instead, that line should simply be ```TYPE: TSP```.
- For the HCP dataset, the file ```alb4000.hcp``` has a wrong entry in line ```8005```. The line should reads ```FIXED_EDGES_SECTION```, instead ```FIXED_EDGES```.
