# Tspf

Tspf is a small library for reading the TSPLIB file format. TSPLIB is a text-based file format often used in the research field of travelling salesman problem, vehicle routing problem and related problems. Some well-known TSP solvers (e.g. [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/index.html) or [LKH](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/)) work mainly with this file format as inputs. The department of Discrete and Combinatorial Optimization at Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg maintains a detailed [documentation](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) for TSPLIB format.

## Status
Currently I'm focusing on implementing an LKH solver (also in Rust). Thus, many features of the parser are still missing, but will be gradually added.
